            Hello! My name is Rohith Mohandas Nayak, and I'm excited to introduce myself to you through this webpage.

            I'm a driven Business Intelligence Engineer Intern at CCC Intelligent Solutions, based in Chicago, USA, currently honing my skills in data visualization and analysis with Tableau. My role involves crafting interactive data visualizations, dashboards, and reports to communicate complex data insights clearly.

            Prior to this, I served as a Business Intelligence Specialist at ABB GLOBAL BUSINESS SERVICES in India, where I excelled in data retrieval, Power BI reporting, and DAX query creation. My experiences at INFOSYS LIMITED in India as a Technology Analyst equipped me with SAP BW implementation skills, incident resolution expertise, and advanced SQL proficiency.

           During my undergraduate years, I developed a keen interest in web development and began my journey by gaining practical experience in creating web applications. To further solidify my skills in web application development, I have taken Web App Foundation course this semester, under the guidance of Prof. Brian Bailey. This course marks the beginning of my deep dive into the world of web development, and I am excited to learn and apply new concepts and techniques. I am committed to leveraging this opportunity to enhance my proficiency in web application development and contribute to exciting projects in the near future.
